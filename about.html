                Katerina Magkaniari (Magarini) embodies the creative fusion of
                artistry, design, and technology.
                With a foundation in architecture, she explored the synergy
                between physical structures and digital spaces. Intrigued by the
                vast possibilities of the digital realm, she delved into web
                development, experimenting with the art of crafting immersive
                online experiences. Her enthusiasm for continuous learning and
                artistic exploration led her to pursue a Master's degree in
                Digital Arts at the Athens School of Fine Arts, where she delved
                deep into the intricacies of the digital medium.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a profound passion for symbiosis, human/non-human
                interaction, and the exploration of meaning within
                interconnected spaces, her work delves into the intersection of
                physical, public, digital, and personal realms, embracing a
                posthuman perspective. Magarini's art serves as a bridge between
                the tangible and the intangible, inviting viewers to reconsider
                their relationships with space, technology, and the complexities
                of the human condition.

            <p>
                Her creations serve as bridges, linking individuals through
                shared experiences and collective meaning, embracing the nuances
                of embodied sensations, the poetics of the everyday and the
                transformative power of genuine connections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her work, characterized by collaborative and playful elements,
                has been featured in exhibitions and publications, including the
                Athens Digital Arts Festival, Primarolia Festival, School of
                Commons, as well as installations in public spaces in
                collaboration with Goethe Institute and OTE Museum.
